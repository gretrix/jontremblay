              I was born in Canada to Mexican-Canadian parents, growing up in a home full of culture, complexity, and chaos. My childhood taught me two things early: how to survive, and how to feel deeply. I moved to the United States when I was eight, carrying with me a sense of disconnection, resilience, and a desire to one day build a life that felt stable, purposeful, and whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              At eighteen, that hope was put to the test. I found myself homeless — no safety net, no roadmap, and no one coming to save me. It was a turning point that forced me to rebuild my mindset, my habits, and my belief in what was possible. I learned that survival can shape you, but responsibility and faith are what transform you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those years taught me discipline, adaptability, and a sense of mission that later drove me to serve in the U.S. Army. My time in the military strengthened the parts of me that had been forged in hardship — loyalty, grit, structure, accountability, and a deep commitment to the people beside me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually, that same drive pushed me into entrepreneurship and technology. I became a systems thinker out of necessity. When life feels unpredictable, you learn to build systems that create order, clarity, and progress — in business, family, faith, and personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm a husband to Linda Tremblay, and a father to three incredible boys — <strong>Carter (12), Leo (11), and Maverick (8)</strong> — and a man committed to breaking generational cycles instead of repeating them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything I create — companies, tools, frameworks, ministries, and teachings — exists for one reason:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="quote-block pl-6 py-4 my-6 italic text-xl text-gray-800">
              To help people grow, heal, and rise above where they started.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I am passionate about turning pain into purpose, brokenness into clarity, and confusion into systems that bring long-term success. I believe character matters, integrity matters, accountability matters, and faith matters. I believe excellence is a form of worship. And I believe every person has the God-given potential to build a life that outlasts them.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey has not been easy, but it has been redemptive. I grew up in difficulty. I was shaped in struggle. I was strengthened in service. And I was rebuilt through faith, family, and calling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I carry those experiences into my work through:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Gretrix LLC</strong> — long-term, deeply integrated MSP + custom development</li>
              <li><strong>Pivotal Tech Solutions</strong> — strategic leadership + technology consulting</li>
              <li><strong>Pivotal Institute Solutions</strong> — education, training, and systems-thinking teaching</li>
              <li><strong>Fortune Leo</strong> — entrepreneurial and investment initiative</li>
              <li><strong>Happy Host</strong> — efficient, systemized short-term rental management</li>
              <li><strong>Joyful Solutions</strong> — emotional, spiritual, and relational growth project built to help people heal and thrive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Everything I do — whether in business, at church, or in the community — flows from this mission:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="quote-block pl-6 py-4 my-6 italic text-xl text-gray-800">
              "Build things that matter. Build people who grow. Honor God in everything."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              My story isn't perfect, but it's purposeful.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if it helps someone else move toward their best life, then it was worth every chapter.
